  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>In this unit, we learned about apps and their components. An app is made of its user interface and inputs/outputs. Inputs are actions such as taps and clicks, and output is a change to what the user sees in response, such as the screen changes. We learned how to make apps and utilize them to make them function properly.</p>

  <b>Unit 4</b>
  <hr>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>This unit taught us about variables in JavaScript, which are named and contain a value, either a string or a number. We learned how to utilize these variables in our app to add extra functionality to them and display them on the screen. We learned about events and how we can use inputs to cause something to change in response. (output). We also learned about logical and comparison operators, both of which can be used in a conditional statement, and assignment operators which assign a new value to a previously declared variable.</p>
