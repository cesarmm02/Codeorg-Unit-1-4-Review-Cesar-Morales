    <b>Lesson 1</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson teaches us how computer science has affected our daily lives and asks us to give an example.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflect and Summarize:</b>
    <h4>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>I learn best by looking back over stuff we learned already, or looking up videos that go over the same stuff so that it might help me. It's similar to the last quote as they wrote down notes that they looked back over at home. I also think about computers in general a lot so it helps me remember some stuff.</h5>

    <b>Lesson 2</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>Taught us how our information sending device we built in class relates to the computer science we will be learning.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflection: Sending Complex Messages</b>
    <h4>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>Because it represented how computers think in binary, with only two options</h5>
    <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="drop">
    <b>Lesson 3</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson taught us the concept of number systems and how they are using in computers.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflection: Counting in Binary</b>
    <h4>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>A number system is a way to order numbers in as many ways as possible using limited options.</h5>
    <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="drop">
    <b>Lesson 4</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson teaches us about bit number systems, such as 4-bit or 8-bit number systems. It teaches us the effects of even adding a single bit to the system, which makes the total combinations double.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
     <b>Reflection: Binary vs Decimal</b>
     <h4>What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
     <h5>Binary systems only use 1 and 0 while decimal numbers use any numbers.</h5>
    <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="drop">
    <b>Lesson 5</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This introduces us to the binary number system and how it compares to others, such as decimal, octal, hexidecimal.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflection: Binary Fractions</b>
    <h4>When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>No, because there's an infinite amount of fractions so at some point you would reach the overflow limit.</h5>
    <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="drop">
    <b>Lesson 6</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This introduces us to abstraction and how computers use it to save space.</p>

    <b>Lesson 7</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson teaches us how to use binary to make a black and white image, and how we can use sampling to simplify an image into bits.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflection: Sampling</b>
    <h4>Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>You would use a smaller sample size, maybe 32 bits as a black and white image is simple for a computer to produce so you wouldn't need that large of a sample size.</h5>
    <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="drop">
    <b>Lesson 8</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This teaches us how we can use the same binary system and method but this time to create images with color, and how expanding the amounts of bits per pixel can increase our range of color.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflection:</b>
    <h4>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>A binary has two states, on or off. 1 is for on and 0 is for off. We can use this to start creating bits of color. This allows us to turn on and off certain colors to make a new color. in a simple sampling process, 100 would create red, since only the red bit is "on".</h5>

    <b>Lesson 9</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>Teaches us more about abstraction and introduces the concepts of lossy and lossless compression in order to save space. In this lesson specifically we use lossless compression.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflection:</b>
    <h4>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider. <br> If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>I would explain that the computer detects patterns, and compresses them in order to save space. It is still understandable, but doesn't take up too much space.</h5>
    <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="drop">
    <b>Lesson 10</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>In this lesson we start to learn about lossy compression and how we can compress and image to save much more space than lossless compression can.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflection:</b>
    <h4>You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>Lossless compression is best for images and video since you'd like to see the content in as high quality as possible, at least so it's visible. Text messages do not have to be lossless, as they are very simple and shouldn't take up much space in the first place.</h5>

    <b>Lesson 11</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson teaches us about copyright and how it is used in digital media to protect your work.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflection:</b>
    <h4>As a reminder, in the warm-up we saw this scenario:<br>Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each.<br>Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>You would need to give the original creator credit for the artwork and some of the money you are receiving from selling it.</h5>

    <b>Lesson 12</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson teaches us about how digitizing information could harm or help us in the future.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflection:</b>
    <h4>Digital Information<br>Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>The modern era is all about the digital world, and things can be stored forever online, as well as it's uses for many other things. We should try to digitize as many things as possible so they can be saved forever. This impacts me personally because I use the internet and digital devices in my daily life.</h5>
