    <b>Lesson 1</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson was about the internet and introducing us to their internet simulator which shows us how sending data works</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Reflection</b>
    <h4>How do you use the Internet? Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>I use the internet to scroll on social media, using my phone, or just using my computer to go on websites. It plays a pretty big role in my life since I use it all the time.</h5>

    <b>Lesson 2</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson shows us how paths can be used to send data from one device to another</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>Redundant Paths</b>
    <h4>Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>A to B to D or A to D to C to D</h5>

    <div class="drop">
    <b>Lesson 3</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson lets us use the internet simulator to send data from one device to another</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
    <b>IP Addresses</b>
    <h4>Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet.</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
    <h5>It allows devices to connect to one IP for the communication device, and send info to another IP. As long as you send it to the same IP, it will go to the same device.</h5>
    <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="drop">
    <b>Lesson 4</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson updates the internet simulator to let us connect to seperate routers and send messages to a single user. It helps us understand the internet since it gives us a better representation of how the internet actually works.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
     <b>Redundancy</b>
     <h4>What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy?</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
     <h5>Building a redundancy means that issues won't be as prevalent, and there is a plan B even if there are issues. Issues with building redundancy can be cost since it can cost some money to build them.</h5>

    <b>Lesson 5</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson shows us how packets work and makes us send messages on an unreliable network, showing us how sometimes the internet may have issues such as sending things out of order or not sending things at all.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>

    <b>Lesson 6</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson teaches us more about how the internet actually works, forcing us to send a request to the DNS to get the IP address of another student before actually being able to send messages to them.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <!-- Q&A -->
      <b>The Growing Internet</b>
      <h4>Choose the two statements that best describe the relationship between HTTP and the World Wide Web</h4>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <h5>The World Wide Web is a collection of pages and files that is shared between computers using HTTP<br>HTTP and the World Wide Web both rely on other layers of protocols for sending information on the Internet</h5>

    <b>Lesson 7</b>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>This lesson helps us revise and review all of what we learned and make sure we understand all of it before moving on to the next unit.</p>
    <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
    <b>End of Unit Survey</b>
    <h4>Thinking about what I learned in this unit, I feel like I understand...</h4>
    <h5>Most of the concepts, but not all of them</h5>
    <h4>I can really be myself in this computer science class.</h4>
    <h5>Slightly agree</h5>
    <h4>What else would you like your teacher to know about this class? For example: what did you like best about the class, or what is one thing that could make the class better?</h4>
    <h5>I do not have anything else I want the teacher to know.</h5>
